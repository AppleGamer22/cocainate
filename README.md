## Description
`cocainate` is a cross-platform CLI utility for keeping the screen awake until stopped, or for a specified duration.

## Why This Name?
The program's functionality and name are inspired by [macOS's `caffeinate`](https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/PowerManagement/blob/main/caffeinate) utility that prevents the system from entering sleep mode.

This name is simply a stupid ~~pun~~, therefore **I do not condone and do not promote drug use**, for more information: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine_(song)).

## Installation (working progress)
### Arch Linux Distributions
* [`yay`](https://github.com/Jguer/yay):
```bash
yay -S cocainate-bin
```
* [`paru`](https://github.com/morganamilo/paru):
```bash
paru -S cocainate-bin
```

### macOS
* [Homebrew Tap](https://github.com/AppleGamer22/homebrew-cocainate):
```bash
brew tap AppleGamer22/cocainate
brew install cocainate
```

### Windows (working progress)
* [`winget`](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli):
```bash
winget install AppleGamer22.cocainate
```
### Other
* `go`:
```
go install github.com/AppleGamer22/cocainate
```

## Functionality
### Root `-d`/`--duration` Flag
This is an optional flag that accepts a duration string (see [Go's `time.ParseDuration`](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) for more details). If this flag is not provided, the program will run until manually stopped.

#### Acceptable Time Units
* nanoseconds: *`ns`*
* microseconds: *`us`* or *`Âµs`*
* milliseconds: *`ms`*
* seconds: *`s`*
* minutes: *`m`*
* hours: *`h`*

#### Examples
* 10 hours: `-d 10h`
* 1 hour, 10 minutes and 10 seconds: `-d 1h10m10s`
* 1 microsecond: `-d 1us`

If the `--pid` flag is provided, the `-d` flag's value is used as process polling interval.

### Root `--pid` Flag
This is an optional flag that accepts a process ID (PID). If a valid PID is provided, the program will wait until that process is terminated. The delay between the termination of the provided process and the termination of screensaver inhibitation depends on the `-d` flag (which must be provided).

### `version` Sub-command
#### `-v`/`--verbose` Flag
* If this flag is provided, the following details are printed to the screen:
	1. semantic version number
	2. commit hash
	3. Go compiler version
	4. processor architecture & operating system
* Otherwise, only the semantic version number is printed.

## Dependencies
### Linux
* [D-Bus](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/)
* One of the following desktop environments:
	* [KDE](https://kde.org) 4 or later
	* [GNOME](https://gnome.org) 3.10 or later
	* Any other desktop environment that implements [`org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver`](https://people.freedesktop.org/~hadess/idle-inhibition-spec/re01.html)
	<!-- * [MATE](https://mate-desktop.org) -->
<!-- ### macOS
* [D-Bus](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/) (optional)
### Windows -->

## Common Contributor Routines
### Testing
Running the following command will run `go test` on the cmd and session sub-modules:
```bash
make test
```
### Building From Source
Running the following command will run `go build` for:
* Linux
	* AMD/Intel 64-bit processors
	* ARM 64-bit processors
	* RISC-V 64-bit processors
* macOS
	* AMD/Intel 64-bit processors
	* ARM 64-bit processors
* Windows
	* AMD/Intel 64-bit processors
	* ARM 64-bit processors

```bash
make build
```

Building from source for an individual operating system is available via:
* Linux
```bash
make linux
```
* macOS
```bash
make mac
```
* Windows
```bash
make windows
```

All binary artificats are stored in the `bin` child directory in the codebase's root directory.

### Packaging
Running the following command will package the program binaries and shell (BASH, ZSH, FISH and PowerShell) completion scripts for:
* Arch Linux Distributions
* macOS
* Windows

```bash
make package
```
